**Module 9 Challenge**

**Overview of the statistical analysis**

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this challenge is to compare the June and December temperatures in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

**Results**

**Three major points:**

* The highs max temperature in June and December are both in the 80s (83 in December and 85 in June), which are both sufficiently hot enough for ice cream and surfing
* The low in December is 56  which is teetering on the lower edge of surfing and ice cream weather, but both can still be enjoyed at that temperature
* The average temperatures are both in the 70s which is perfect for ice cream and surfing

**Summary**

**High-Level Summary:**

In all, surfing and ice cream can be enjoyed all year round in Oahu. The temperature may on occasion drop to the edge of surfing and ice cream weather in December, but those days would be outliers. This means that there is a definite opportunity for the surfing and ice cream shop because both products can be sold all year round.

**Two Additional Queries:**

* It would be good to get the levels of precipitation. If it is overly rainy in certain months, people may not go surfing or buy ice cream as much.
* Cloud coverage and wind would be good to look at too. If it is overly cloudy and windy in certain months the surfing may not be as good. Also when it is not as nice out people   are less inclined to buy ice cream
